# React Form

## Two bindway and self-plugin babel

#### `debounce` `uncontrol` `validation`

#### `npm`

Install node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

All that's necessary to get an environment running, with a simple server to send the application and assets:

```bash
npm run web
```

The filesystem will be watched for changes, and will be served on
`http://localhost:8080/`.
